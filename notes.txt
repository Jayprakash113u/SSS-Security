Cyber Crime and Cyber Law

Information is a resource which has no value until it is extracted, processed and utilized. Information technology deals with information system, data storage, access, retrieval, analysis and intelligent decision making. Information technology refers to the creation, gathering, processing, storage, presentation and dissemination of information and also the processes and devices that enable all this to be done.

Information technology is affecting us as individual and as a society. Information technology stands firmly on hardware and software of a computer and tele-communication infrastructure. But this is only one facet of the information Technology, today the other facets are the challenges for the whole world like cyber crimes and more over cyber terrorism. When Internet was first developed, the founding fathers hardly had any inkling that internet could transform itself into an all pervading revolution which could be misused for criminal activities and which required regulations. With the emergence of the technology the misuse of the technology has also expanded to its optimum level the examples of it are:
- Cyber stalking
- Cyber harassment
- Cyber fraud
- Cyber defamation
- Spam
- Hacking
- Trafficking
- Distribution
- Posting and dissemination of obscene material including pornography,
- Indecent exposure and child pornography etc.

Computer Virus

A computer virus is a malicious program that self-replicates by copying itself to another program. In other words, the computer virus spreads by itself into other executable code or documents. The purpose of creating a computer virus is to infect vulnerable systems, gain admin control and steal user sensitive data. Hackers design computer viruses with malicious intent and prey on online users by tricking them.

One of the ideal methods by which viruses spread is through emails – opening the attachment in the email, visiting an infected website, clicking on an executable file, or viewing an infected advertisement can cause the virus to spread to your system. Besides that, infections also spread while connecting with already infected removable storage devices, such as USB drives.
